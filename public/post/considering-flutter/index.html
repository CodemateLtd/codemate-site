<p>Most people, including me 4 months ago, don’t know what the heck Flutter is.</p>

<h2 id="yet-another-one-of-these-frameworks">Yet another one of these frameworks</h2>

<p>I accidentally stumbled upon <strong>Flutter</strong> when reading about Google’s Fuchsia. Hearing about Flutter being the <em>native SDK for Fuchsia</em>, I had to take a look.</p>

<p>I landed on the <a href="https://flutter.io/">Flutter home page</a> and spotted the sales pitch:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Flutter is a new mobile app SDK to help developers and designers build modern mobile apps for iOS and Android.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Oh right, yet another one of these frameworks</em>, I thought. As a native mobile developer, I wasn’t really convinced by any of the existing cross-platform frameworks so far. The most promising until now was <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>, which I actually tried on a couple occasions.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-at-least-give-it-a-try">Let&rsquo;s at least give it a try</h2>

<p>Having used only statically typed languages the last 5 years, the problem in React Native for me was the dynamic nature of Javascript. My incompetence with the build system, transpilers and webpack also didn’t help. I tried to setup TypeScript but had no luck there.</p>

<p>Also, coming from the early days of Android development, where <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/memory.html#Abstractions">using enums was discouraged due to memory concerns</a>, the approach of shipping <strong>an entire Javascript runtime</strong> and interpreting code on the fly seemed quite a hog for me.</p>

        <img src="/considering-flutter/iiro-koodaa-flutter.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>Having kind of an “I’ve seen this before” feeling, I installed the Flutter SDK. Flutter used Dart on so-called Strong Mode, so I’d be getting the static typing I was used to. <em>There’s nothing to lose at least giving it a try</em>, I thought.</p>

<p>A solid 4 months later, after doing a lot with Flutter, here I am writing you about it.</p>

<h2 id="from-tech-talk-to-a-real-talk">From tech-talk to a real talk</h2>

<p>We here at Codemate are generally passionate about new technologies. A day doesn’t go by without someone posting something on our Slack about some new tech. That’s why we have our dedicated Slack channel for that, called <strong>#tech-talk</strong>.</p>

<p>A couple weeks ago, I stumbled upon an article called <a href="https://hackernoon.com/whats-revolutionary-about-flutter-946915b09514">What’s Revolutionary about Flutter</a>. I thought it was a great article, so I posted the link to our <strong>#tech-talk</strong> channel.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/considering-flutter/tech_talk_whats_revolutionary_flutter.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>Little did I know what the consequences would be. Pertti, one of our software architects, read the whole article through. He was being a little skeptic at this point. Pertti thought Flutter seemed to be <em>almost too good to be true</em>.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/considering-flutter/perttis_disbelief.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>I told Pertti that I’ve used it for a good 4 months, and it really is a great technology. This spurred some private conversation with him. He had a lot of questions about Flutter and I answered to him as well as I could.</p>

<p>After conversing with Pertti for a good 30 minutes, he dropped the bomb.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I just spoke to Lasse, our CPO. You’re hosting a company-wide Flutter presentation in a couple weeks.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fast-forward to yesterday, I was presenting my Google Slides to a little short of thirty people, including a handful of our software architects.</p>

<h2 id="the-slides-and-source-code">The slides and source code</h2>

<p>The first slides are a brief introduction to Flutter. Then they go through a sample app, breaking it into small sections.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="afa3c8a12be74a24b4d334e3155ed401" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

<p><br />
Here are couple screenshots on how the sample app looks like:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/considering-flutter/app_screeens.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>The sample app consists of two screens: one being a list of random profiles loaded from an API, one being a profile details page.</p>

<p>All the source code for the <a href="https://github.com/CodemateLtd/FlutterMates">sample app is located here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-reception">The reception</h2>

<p>The presentation spurred up some great discussion. Admittedly, I presented some points about the Flutter Widget rendering in a confusing way. For that, I blame my nerves.</p>

<p>Our architects, which generally come from a web background, thought the presentation was good. I’m even seeing some interest in Flutter from their end.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/considering-flutter/juhamattis_overalls.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>Juhamatti, or “iiska”, is one of our go-to guys in web development related things. Ask anything web related and he knows. After the presentation, both him and Pertti said that it would be interesting to give Flutter a try.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-actually-use-this">Can we actually use this?</h2>

<p>I recently had a discussion with our Helsinki site manager about doing customer projects with Flutter. I really liked the answer, which was something along the lines of this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I can’t give you a yes or no answer. Ask your mobile developer colleagues on Slack. We’ll decide based on that.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point <strong>I didn’t even care</strong> if I got the green light or not. I felt it was such a <em>fair</em> thing to do. So, I went ahead and asked the question on our <strong>#mobdev</strong> Slack channel.</p>

<p>That spurred a couple pages worth of discussion, with 5 yays and 1 nay. We reached to a democratic conclusion that can be seen here:</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="/considering-flutter/living_in_a_democracy.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>“If Iiro would die…” – that’s the typical Finnish attitude towards life. To weigh the pros and cons in something, we always <strong>assume the worst</strong>. I was ready to just get a “no” as an answer. I was met with a <em>stamp of approval</em> from almost the whole mobile team instead.</p>

<p>In my experience from the last 4 months, Flutter is mature enough for making even complex apps. However, in its current state, it doesn’t fit every use case. For example, if you wish to use Bluetooth or need a full-fledged mobile database like Realm, you’re better off with something else. Unless you like to wait or create native plugins yourself, which you can totally do.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you haven’t, I encourage you to <a href="https://flutter.io/setup/">try Flutter</a>. As with any new technology, there’s some learning curve involved. Thankfully the developer experience is pleasant and the documentation is amazing. The Flutter team is being really helpful on their <a href="https://gitter.im/flutter/flutter">Gitter group</a>, Stack Overflow and GitHub issues. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/">/r/FlutterDev</a> subreddit has plenty of helpful content coming every week.</p>

<p>For the use cases Flutter fits in, it matches and even outperforms its competition. Out of all these cross-platform frameworks, I really believe <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIIgtClYq0s">Flutter could be the One</a>.</p>
