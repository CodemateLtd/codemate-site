# Codemate site

An ongoing project in porting our site from WordPress to Hugo.

## Creating a new post

For example, if we'd create a new post:

1. hugo new post/hello-world.md
2. mkdir static/hello-world

Now we have the post and an asset folder set up for a new post. 

### Post images and other assets

Add images to the *static/hello-world* folder.

There's two special kind of images that you should add there:

1. thumbnail.png, which is the thumbnail image on the article listing grid
2. header.png, which is the header image for the post.
